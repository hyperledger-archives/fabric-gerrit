<strong>Project</strong>: fabric</br><strong>Branch</strong>: master<br><strong>ID</strong>: 5995<br><strong>Subject</strong>: [FAB-2243] Replace Tx Validation bit-array by flags<br><strong>Status</strong>: MERGED<br><strong>Owner</strong>: Ruslan Kryukov - ruslan.kryukov@ru.ibm.com<br><strong>Assignee</strong>:<strong>Created</strong>: 2/14/2017, 7:59:18 AM<br><strong>LastUpdated</strong>: 2/27/2017, 11:56:58 AM<br><strong>CommitMessage</strong>:<br><pre>[FAB-2243] Replace Tx Validation bit-array by flags

https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2243

Switch valid flag from a boolean to an enum, so that we can indicate the reason
for the invalidation (txid already exists, vscc validation failure
(endorsement policy failure), mvcc validation failure, etc)

This change adds invalidation reason codes, sets them in the block as a uint8
(byte) array, and returns validation result in GetTransactionById.

Ruslan, please describe the motivation in the commit message.

Binh, are you agreeable if we change the tran validation bit array to a unit8 array? This way the value can indicate an invalidation reason code, e.g. txid already exists, vscc validation failure (endorsement policy failure), mvcc validation failure, etc.  0 would be valid and the various invalidation reason codes could start at 1.  I expect most clients and auditors would want to know why it got invalidated.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Ruslan Kryukov - ruslan.kryukov@ru.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 2/16/2017, 2:41:27 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Uploaded patch set 9.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Hyperledger Jobbuilder - jobbuilder@jenkins.hyperledger.org<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 2/16/2017, 2:45:26 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 9:

slices and string variables are always pointers implicitly in golang... 

I don't know what you meant by `reassigned`. In your code, you are actually resolving these pointers in you function code... What's the point of declaring the method on a pointer when you have to resolve this pointer in the function body.

I think that simplest would be just try the code that I suggested and let's see where you get stuck. Does this sound reasonable?</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Ruslan Kryukov - ruslan.kryukov@ru.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 2/16/2017, 7:42:26 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 9:

I mean that example:
func (obj TxValidationFlags) SetFlag(i int, flag peer.TxValidationResult) {
	if uint(i) >= uint(len(obj)) {
		array := make(TxValidationFlags, uint(i)+1)
		copy(array, obj)
		obj = array
	}

	(obj)[i] = uint8(flag)
}

>obj = array
This line. Actually we doesn't assign array to method receiver 'obj' and if we call other method then len(obj) still be zero.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Manish Sethi - manish.sethi@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 2/16/2017, 8:08:33 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 9:

What I was suggesting is that we do not need dynamic expansion at all. We need to create this flag array either for a new block (in which case we know the size before hand) or we need to create it from already stored flags (in this case also we know the actual content).

Can you think of a situation which I may have missed... where this code for expansion would be used.

So, I was suggesting to avoid unnecessary complexity. For simplicity, think of it this way that we are dealing with []uint8 in our code straight... just an alias is defined for readability. More than that would be unnecessary in my opinion.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Ruslan Kryukov - ruslan.kryukov@ru.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 2/16/2017, 8:37:16 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 9:

When we run test core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/validator/statebasedval/state_based_validator_test.go

it calls inside method ValidateAndPrepareBatch. Inside method contains instruction:
txsFilter := util.TxValidationFlags(block.Metadata.Metadata[common.BlockMetadataIndex_TRANSACTIONS_FILTER])

sizeof(block.Metadata.Metadata[common.BlockMetadataIndex_TRANSACTIONS_FILTER]) == 0

When filter is created, he has size 0.

BUT some lines below we have:
txsFilter.SetFlag(txIndex, peer.TxValidationResult_INVALID)

Go has panic: out of range cuz txIndex > len(txsFilter)

So, test is failed.

If we use array with expand function, result of test will be success.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Manish Sethi - manish.sethi@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 2/16/2017, 8:52:40 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 9:

Please replace the line that you pointed out `txsFilter := util.TxValidationFlags(block.Metadata.Metadata[common.BlockMetadataIndex_TRANSACTIONS_FILTER])` by the following

I think no, but, for example, I can extend list of validation flags.

Ruslan, "Could not get deployment transaction from LCCC for example02:0 " implies that the ledger entry to the LCCC chaincode is not found.

There are two RW sets at the end of a in instantiation of a chaincode on the ledger. (1) the RW set belonging to the user chaincode and (2) the RW set belonging to the LCCC chaincode registering the user chaincode.

I don't see any other errors before that error message which makes me think somehow the commit to the ledger at the end of the TX did not go through for (2) (and maybe (1) did not go through either).</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Srinivasan Muralidharan - srinivasan.muralidharan99@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 2/19/2017, 1:59:47 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 24:

Please remove NOT_DEFINED. Why would peer ever set this in the array?
In my opinion, NOT_DEFINED gives more information then just -1... And if we call a method with incorrect txIndex, it would be better to return NOT_DEFINED instead of panic 'index out of range'. I understand, in this case I suppress exception, but....

if someone queries for transaction status with wrong txID, it's much cleaner to return an error "txID not found" rather than returning the transaction status as NOT_DEFINED.

If I understand your argument for INVALID correctly, it will never be returned but you have it and use as a temp initialization in internal code. If my understanding is correct, proto file (and exposing this outside) is not the right place for these. Is there a problem if you initialize with any code?

Suppressing "index out of range" is not good.

I have done almost all comments.. but may be skipped something by mistake...
Also

>core/common/validation/msgvalidation.go
Line 369:
Will error be always because of this reason? See comment in line 349

I saw code and noticed that ValidationCode for now is same, but error messages are different.
