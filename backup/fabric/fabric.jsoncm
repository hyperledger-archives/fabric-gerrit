    "commitMessage": "[FAB-9059] add metadata to chaincode platforms\n\nMetadata was introduced into the chaincode package for\nhandling couchdb indexes. However the implementation\nassumed chaincode will be in the targz format inside\nChaincodeDeploymentSpec. The CAR platform does not use\ntargz format and this exposes the weakness with the\nimplementation - the metadata should really be derived\nfrom the platform interface.\n\nThis is the first of the series that moves chaincode\nmetadata to the platform interface. This only lays the\nplatform foundation (via a \"MetadataProvider\" supplied\nby each platform) and does not have the rest of the code\nactually use it. That will be done in the next CR.\n\nChange-Id: I7a121cda03a7da543da5342a2f692195bebeb45c\nSigned-off-by: Srinivasan Muralidharan <srinivasan.muralidharan99@gmail.com>\n",

This one is the  initial  proposal message validation that we see a lot users run into (the validation tracks well formedness, signature validation etc) that's useful to capture as a metric. Maybe we should call this \"Proposal Validation\" instead of \"Initial Validation\" ?\n\nAlso to your point though, we have a \"ProposalsReceived\" which captures the total proposals received. Perhaps we should add a \"SuccessfulProposals\" counter so users can see \"total failure = total proposals - total successful proposals\"",

The ACL support is fixed and provided\nout of the defaultprovider but in future we could consider having users\nspecify policies for these resources.\n\nNote that the call to CheckACL with empty channelID conveniently resolves to\ncall to policy.CheckPolicyNoChannel (same call used for channeless ACL calls\nin the system chaincodes).\n\nChange-Id: Iaf7c49f030149ab89dd4814d5aa4c5b4d59a4fd6\nSigned-off-by: muralisr <srinivasan.muralidharan99@gmail.com>\n",

            "message": "Just a feedback on the readability from someone who looked at this code for the first time - I found this a bit confusing pattern where both p resources and c resources are treated equally and then try to follow different code path.\n\nI guess that it should be cleaner if we have a separate config provider for c resources that consults channel config followed by defaults and similarly a separate one for p resource that simply returns from defaults. This would attach the meaning of \"default\" to values as opposed to \"behavior\" making it more clear IMO.",

The base code change is small and cleanly separated. We can complete rest of the work including docs and samples and get this out with low risk to realize the signficant benefits of the new model. Any other work is internal and can be done independent of the model change work. That can be done in the shim separation work and can be done separately. As an additional benefit, we will have a working model along with supporting tests/docs to compare.",

This\nfits with not only with the existing runtime model, it also fits with the\nnew lifecycle deployment model where the chaincode \"package\" (and the\npackage identifier) is separated from the chaincode \"name\". The former is\npart of the deployment model while the later part of the transaction (via\ninvoke) model. In particular treating external chaincode as a new platform\nallows us to fit deployment of the external chaincode with the chaincode\nframework without altering the invoke interactions.\n\nChange-Id: I8bc3bc887915eaa20e642a4b2c2a906d6300bc09\nSigned-off-by: muralisr <srinivasan.muralidharan99@gmail.com>\n",

If we are sure we want a common set of utils for tx validation, then I think we need to make it very clear and explicit in that package that any modifications must be entirely deterministic and will break validation if we get it wrong.

We aren't happy with what we have, which is one of the reasons we're re-implementing it.\n\nNot to pick on names again.  But... 'ValidateCommonHeader'.  How does this have 3 return values?  The name says we are validating... I would expect only an error.  I can infer by looking at it, that most likely, it is going to check the signature and channel header fields for nil, and unmarshal each of them, and if either of those are nil, or the unmarshaling fails, return an error.\n\nThe above was my honest-pre-checking the function impression of the code.  When I actually look inside the code, I see now that it's also checking the initial input for nil, it's also performing a deeper validation on each of the signature header and channel header, including explicitly checking the types of transactions that are allowed.  There are also a number of TODO statements in the channel header validation which a helpful soul might go and implement, ruining our determinism.\n\nThis goes back to my original skepticism.  Building validation on utility functions is a house of cards, waiting to collapse.  If we want to use utility functions IMO they need to be very limited in scope, and have very clear inputs and outputs.\n\nSo, my humble suggestion would be to use nothing in core/common/validation, and, if we are convinced we want to create some common and useful utility functions, let's generate them here, in the tx processor factory.

If we think of these as just Fabric's \"default\" implementation for ENDORSER and CONFIG transactions then moving them into internal would signify that. If we to strongly suggest these are better not overridden and keep it as a fixture in core implementation, better leave it in core. Easy enough to move but the distinction is important.

It follows that most of fabric code will be \"internal\". Do we want to apply the golang guidance of the use of the \"internal\" package literally ?",

There is a dependency on BCCSP in bundle code for creating this (there's a comment in code for an alternate implementation to pass configtx.Validator directly, but that has other implications.)

Having one concrete externalbuilders.Instance will force it to be a container for  multiple implementations (not to mention the if/then/else in start/wait/stop)\n\nThe separation into LauncherInstance and ConnectorInstance makes the separation clean. Other changes such as returning Instance interface instead of *Instance concrete type and exposing the metadata in NewInstance stem from this separation.\n\nBy the way the CR up the stack with the full implementation of ConnectorInstance might help clarify.",

My thought had been that we do the build there, and, if it is a remotecc style chaincode, we no longer need to try to manage the container lifecycle, as it's done for us.\n\nSo, essentially we'd have Build, Release, if not remote, call into container_runtime.go, if remote, simply start the connection.  Starting the connection I would expect would be much easier to wire from runtime_launcher.go as you already have access to the handler resources that you need, so need to pass them to the instance.",

            "message": "I think my concern here, is that the abstraction that exists was designed for locally launched and managed chaincodes.\n\nFor instance, as we look down the stack, we see that Start(...) which used to take a CID and the peer connection info, now takes a more generic 'ConnectionInfo'.  In the case of a locally launched chaincode that connection into is generated by peer itself.  In the case of a remotely launched chaincode, that connection info which is passed in is actually the info that the launcher provided.  Basically, we are wiring the connection info out of the externalbuilder, into container.go, into the container_runtime.go, into runtime_launcher.go, back to container_runtime.go, back to container.go, back to externalbuilder, to the same *Instance which originated it.  It makes the API consistent, but also really strange.  It's the instance that knows how to connect to the chaincode, why is the instance being told how to connect?\n\nAnother place that doesn't really make sense to me is 'Wait()', there's nothing to wait on, the connection stays open, or it hangs up, and the launcher code cleans it up.\n\nAnd finally 'Stop', can't actually stop the chaincode, all it can do is disconnect.\n\nWe've also introduced a new cyclical dependency in our wiring.  The chaincode package needs a reference to the containers, which needs a reference to the external builders, which needs a reference to the chaincode stream handler in the chaincode package.  So, the change must add\n\n +       // chaincode support's stream handler is used by peer to connect to chaincode server\n +       externalVM.ConnectionHandler = chaincodeSupport\n\nto internal/peer/node/start.go\n\nIt basically seems to me like we're applying a lot of verbs which make sense for locally launched chaincode to the remote chaincode for the sake of interface re-use, when in fact they're quite different.\n\nMy feeling is, that if we simply add `ConnectionInfo` to the normal \"*Instance', and in runtime launcher if there's connection info returned by the instance, use the existing go routine which would otherwise invoke Start()+Wait() to start the chaincode stream (of course falling back to use the old container_runtime.go path as needed).  Basically copy lines 151-190 of https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/fabric/+/34099/3/core/container/externalbuilders/connectorinstance.go#151 out of the connectorinstance and into the chaincode package to be referenced by runtime_launcher.go, hang lines 52-70 off of the existing *Instance, and I think it's more or less done?\n\n> It also provides a pattern for other potential Instances to follow.\n\nSo I'm really wondering what that might be?  After this stack, we'll have two types of chaincode, locally launched, and remote.  What third type of instance are you thinking of?  It seems like to me that either:\n\na) The instance supplies the connection info to the launcher (remote)\nb) The launcher supplies the connection info to the instance (local)\n\nI don't really see any other possible permutations.  Even if we added a new non-externalbuidler chaincode type (say... for whatever reason we wanted to do some sort of native k8s to replace or supplement the docker platforms), we'd still be operating under this framework.",

            "message": "In general, we avoid exporting things, because we don't want to allow users outside of a package to create a dependency on the structure.  However, since this structure really does represent our external contract with the externalbuilders, we really already have our hands tied with respect to the changes we can make to it.\n\nTo me, exporting this would signal that in fact, we do need to consider any changes we make to the contract of this structure.\n\nI think we both come from a Java-like background where the mantra is 'encapsulate everything, be private by default, never export unless there's a very strong reason to. ' and I've personally struggled to force myself to invert this for golang.  That unless there's a very good reason not to export a structure, export it.  Go does not generally do runtime linking, so breaking changes are noticed immediately, adding new struct fields does not break intializations, and, exporting fields makes doing integration style tests much easier (to avoid having to worry about dependency cycles, when testing from _test or dedicated integration packages).\n\nIf we were writing this as library code, then we'd want to be very careful with what we export, but we aren't.  In fact, I think it's been a bit harmful that we seem to send mixed messages with hiding implementations and trying to present stable interfaces while simultaneously reserving the right to change those interfaces.",

Everywhere we use `viper.GetDuration` (which is a lot of places), you get what you intend if you specify a unit, and nanos if you don't.  We can debate the merit of whether this is the desirable default behavior (especially as we overhaul config in the coming releases), but to me, consistency, even with weird behavior, is far preferable to special casing.\n\nIf, and, I'm vehemently opposed to this, we wanted to denote this config value in seconds, then the config value should be \"dial_timeout_seconds\".  If I were to say \"The dial timeout is 100\", the immediate reaction would be \"Seconds or milliseconds?\"  \"The weather outside is 40\", is either a chilly day in Fahrenheit or a scorcher in Celsius.   Numbers are meaningless without units.",

    "commitMessage": "[FAB-15897] Improve CLI perf w/ multiple endorsers\n\nIf you specify multiple peers to \"peer chaincode invoke\", currently\nthese endorsements are run one at a time, in order specified on the CLI.\n\nThis is slow, which might not be seen as a problem for the CLI, however\nin the current version of chaincode lifecycle this command is used to\ntrigger the building of chaincode containers. This may be causing CI failures\nwhen chaincode needs to be built in a single transaction across multiple\npeers.\n\nThis change runs the endorsements concurrently, which should trigger\nthe chaincode to be built across all peers simultaneously. Also, this is\nhow the various SDKs behave today.\n\nSigned-off-by: Simon Stone <sstone1@uk.ibm.com>\nChange-Id: Ib9f69c7bbd7f4f1197f2959599e45d0a2545d366\n",

That said, I've received input from others that they prefer the underscore prefix so the tree isn't hidden and that's what has colored the implementation.\n\nAt the end of the day, I don't much care which way we go. I will change the underscore to a dot and if people feel strongly about going back to an underscore, they can -1 the CR and I'll let you all sort it out. :)",

The main\npackage for the impacted samples now live under a cmd folder in the\nexample.\n\nSince some of the examples were actually used as test fixtures, some of\nthe users needed updates to reflect the new location of the main.\n\nGiven the need to update callers anyway, we removed chaincode_ prefix\nfrom the directory names and the _exampleXX suffix chaincode source\nfiles as they were redundant.

There are a\nnumber of these fixtures that live in the incorrectly named top level\n`test` directory.\n\nInstead of keeping fixtures in one location, this commit moves the\nassets closer to the tests that use them and makes the necessary path\nmodifications to reference them.\n\nTests that were relying on fixtures to live on the go path, were\nmodified to explicitly set the gopath to the testdata directory.\n\nChange-Id: I5dbc0cb5af41c63289aea925b08fea1584ca598f\nSigned-off-by: Matthew Sykes <sykesmat@us.ibm.com>\n",

And I do use them from time to time in my local testing.  For some reason these folders were excluded from the test execution, I suppose because they have no tests? But it would have been nice for catching these compile errors.\n\nIn any event, I concur, the samples should have some tests to make sure that they work.",
