(The folder 'tools/PTE/ccArgumentsGenerator/<cc-type>/' already contains transaction-generation logic specific to <cc-type>.)\n\nWe can also create application-specific sub-folders within 'NL', just like in 'PTE'. I didn't do that only because it seemed to me that 'NL' was envisioned to be application-agnostic, unlike PTE.",

(More than one chaincode can very well use a common map.) I think it's best to associate this file only with NL and leave PTE completely out of it. As you stated in your other comment, someone who runs PTE on a custom business network must already have generated an appropriate network and configuration files, either using NL or some other mechanism.\n\nI'll just change the file reference to NL/sampleOrgMap.json and resubmit if you are OK with it.",

I made all the changes you asked for (including replacement of tabs with spaces) bar one: in the commit message, I left the part about selection of signing identity. What the code does is \"collects\" signing identities for all the orgs once per thread, and then assigns (one of) the right ones when it comes time to dispatch a transaction. So the commit message is accurate, but I can add these details if you want me to.",

Since we offered the --npm, maybe we should ask the user to use that option the first time, and allow them to rerun the tests more efficiently by skipping the npm install. I guess it does not hurt to redo it, and is less to worry about for the user if we just do it everytime, but this also means we cannot run these test suites (sanity, and all) withOUT doing the npm install and the install/instantiate chaincodes. Pros and cons. Any other opinions?",

See below for more details about the predefined tests.\nA connection profile is required as input; and your network must be running (with channels created, peers joined, etc) before starting these tests.\nThe connection profile may be based on the fabric deployment of choice (cloud offering, Cello, K8S or customized deployment).\nFor reference, a formatted sample connection profile is provided in the default location ./connectionprofile/.

This script is intended for CI. \n\nThere is a way to get the commit from nexus,  see this change here. https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test/commit/cca8ff4a3d211c86c63ba7178cbb37ba5fc4a7b4#diff-f1054586715c6c45eeb16520e5346d2d.. But as mentioned in comment, some times we are not getting the right commit from nexus maven-metadata.xml file. All these binaries are available at https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/releases/org/hyperledger/fabric/",

But if not, then don’t spend more time on them; we already disabled the OTE job in master branch, and will disable the OTE tests in 1.4 too if there are any problems.\n\nAnd, although we are going to stop running Behave tests in all branches some time soon (probably end of 2019 or so), we do still need them until we deliver release 1.4.4. So, it is good that you ported changes to feature/ to keep those running for now. I know some are failing, so we are just looking to keep the passing tests passing, when comparing the existing daily test results (https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-test/job/fabric-test-daily-behave-release-1.4-x86_64/) with your behave-daily test results in sandbox including all these changes.",

We can debug that as needed separately.\nA couple other tests also failed a few (1 or 5) TXs out of 4000; we suspect that is also due to the resources. We can troubleshoot those if they recur in the coming daily runs.\nMerging this will allow everyone to see and tweak as necessary.",

            "message": "By doing this, with one proc per org and one orgName listed, it should avoid the timeouts during the initial few transactions on the peers where the cc containers are not yet running. We restrict the traffic to the first peer in the first org listed, which is where we do the instantiation, which means the cc container should be there already.\n\nNote this cuts in half the number of transactions, because listOpt contained two - versus just one peer when using OrgAnchor and one procPerOrg.\n\nLongterm, we should fix the network startup so we can (with this or other tests) use multiple peers for the traffic. One thing that might help is setting env var core_chaincode_installTimeout, which was added in FAB-16876 to fabric master (default 300s) this morning (and might actually get this test to pass if we retest on latest fabric images tomorrow).",
